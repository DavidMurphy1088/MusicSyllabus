<h1>Echo Clap</h1>

An interval is the distance between two notes. In the exam you will be shown three notes, and be asked to identify the intervals as either a second or a third.

<br><br>
<ul>
  <li>It's important that you begin to clap straight away, once the examiner has finished their rhythm so that you don't lose the sense of pulse.
</li>
  <li>If you are unsure of the whole rhythm and can only remember parts of it, that's ok, the BEST thing to do is to keep the pulse.
</li>
  <li>Think about what you do know - this will be 4 bars in length and will either be in 2-time or 3-time. If you can feel how many beats are in the bar, do your best to keep to this structure.</li>
  <li>Don't try to remember the first bar as this leads to not listening to the following bars. Do your best to feel the general rhythmic shape instead.
</li>
  <li>If you can recall the final bar, this makes for a strong ending. Think simply: Was it a long note perhaps?
</li>

</ul>
