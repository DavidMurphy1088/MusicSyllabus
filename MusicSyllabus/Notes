What is SiriKit - If you're a developer, you can also integrate Siri into your app using the SiriKit framework. This allows users to interact with your app using voice commands. To test SiriKit in your app, you'll need to have a development profile and run your app on a physical device that supports Siri. You can find more information on SiriKit development in the Apple Developer Documentation.
